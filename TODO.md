## TODO

- Team/Meeting membership checks
- Remove sessionUserTeams stuff for now
- Put arbitrary limit on number of teams a user can be in
- Custom Exception
- ENSURE NO APPEND TEAM WHILE STILL LOADING/ERRORED
- Add tests for redux (and stuff like defaults)
- Add README section on Typescript errors (requireAuthentication is a pain)
- Set up Redux logger
- Error handling
- Async tests (no sleep())
- Add dateCreated and dateUpdated fields for items and meetings
- SSHD
- Remove serve in nginx

## BREAKING

- Allow meeting venues to be an optional attribute, while still keeping empty string checks
